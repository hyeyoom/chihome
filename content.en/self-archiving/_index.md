# Self-Archiving

Some time ago, I read a book called **How to Review Myself(나를 리뷰 하는 법)** in a book club.
It wasn’t a book filled with remarkable insights, but the idea of recording what you see, hear, and feel—even the way you work—felt genuinely interesting.

At the time, I thought of it as something I might try someday and moved on.
Recently, however, as several changes have arrived all at once, I started to feel a vague anxiety—that without recording myself, I might end up losing myself.

That’s why I decided to name the first category of this blog Self-Archiving.
Looking back, restarting this blog was also triggered by that earlier reading experience.

After settling on the category, I looked the book up again,
and noticed that the phrase Self Archiving is printed right on the cover.
